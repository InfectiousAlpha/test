\section{The Gradient of a Distribution and the Backward Pass}
\label{sec:backward_pass_distribution}

% This subchapter will present a theoretical discussion on how to perform the
% backward pass in this new framework. It will introduce the concept of
-
% backpropagating the statistical loss to derive a "meta-gradient" that
% updates the network's weights based on their effect on the entire output
% distribution, not just on individual samples. This will connect the vision
% to the mechanics of backward AMP.
